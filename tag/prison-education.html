<h1 id="teaching-python-to-rikers-detainees">Teaching Python to Rikers Detainees</h1>
<p>On Saturday, December 10th, I had the privilege of joining students from<br>
the Columbia School of Social Work to teach the Python computer language to <br>
a class of 20 young detainees at Rikers python.  The course is part of digital <br>
storytelling class concieved of and pioneered by the brilliant and compasionate<br>
<a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in">Dennis Tennen</a>.  The project seeks as a promary goal to teach detainees the <br>
power and techniques of digital storytelling by engaging them with familiar <br>
elements such as social media and unfamiliar technology such as Python and <br>
computational thinking.  </p>
<p>As a secondary goal, the program seeks to inform young men trapped in<br>
the some of the darkest and most disfunctional aspects of our Criminal<br>
Justice system (money bail, indeterminate pre-trial detention,<br>
poverty, violence, inadequate food and constant uncomfortable<br>
accomodations) that mastery of digital storytelling or Python<br>
programming may be a viable path out of poverty either with or without<br>
a college degree.</p>
<p>The picture above was taken on Rikers Island in the last place we were<br>
allowed to keep our phones.  It is the parking lot outside the<br>
<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/teen-murder-at-rikers-jail-6394103">infamous</a> Robert N.  Davoren complex where prisoners as young as<br>
sixteen are detained. For those interested in learning more about these <br>
fascinating young men and their struggle to survive inside and make sense<br>
of their brutal surroundings, please follow <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%2540rikersbot&amp;src=typd">@RikersBot</a>.</p>
<p>If you can spare four minutes to hear why this work is so important, please watch<br>
