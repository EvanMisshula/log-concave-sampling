&lt;p&gt;This is not the optimal transport reading group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo is of the Spring 2025 Advanced Probability class on our last &lt;br&gt;
day of office hours, May 3rd. We were treated to a new lecture that explained&lt;br&gt;
the way in which to proability measures where one was absolutely continuous&lt;br&gt;
with the other but not the reverse led to a process being a strict local &lt;br&gt;
martingale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it is typical that this many people smile in a math class&lt;br&gt;
but I have not seen it often. The OT Reading Group came out of a graduate&lt;br&gt;
class on Probability and Analysis.  Jose, our organizer was using OT in his&lt;br&gt;
research on multiple sorces of factor risk and suggested Dr. Karatzas &lt;br&gt;
give us his treatment of the material. (&lt;a href="https://www.ndguillen.com/"&gt;Dr. Nestor Gullien&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
gave 4 lectures. The lectures were so popular that we formed a &lt;br&gt;
reading group for the next semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our surprise and delight gave a series of lectures from the&lt;br&gt;
perspective of Partial Differential Equations, all of us had at least&lt;br&gt;
some experience with that area. Dr. Karatzas then continued and gave&lt;br&gt;
us his perspective on the proofs of Benhamou and Brenier and&lt;br&gt;
Rockefeller on convex optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a pedagological viewpoint it was far ahead of most of us&lt;br&gt;
but part of the magic of high rather than low expectations is that &lt;br&gt;
people work hard to rise to them. And I would assert that Victor &lt;br&gt;
Frankl would claim that is the reason for the smiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, December 10th, I had the privilege of joining students from&lt;br&gt;
the Columbia School of Social Work to teach the Python computer language to &lt;br&gt;
a class of 20 young detainees at Rikers python.  The course is part of digital &lt;br&gt;
storytelling class concieved of and pioneered by the brilliant and compasionate&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in"&gt;Dennis Tennen&lt;/a&gt;.  The project seeks as a promary goal to teach detainees the &lt;br&gt;
power and techniques of digital storytelling by engaging them with familiar &lt;br&gt;
elements such as social media and unfamiliar technology such as Python and &lt;br&gt;
computational thinking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a secondary goal, the program seeks to inform young men trapped in&lt;br&gt;
the some of the darkest and most disfunctional aspects of our Criminal&lt;br&gt;
Justice system (money bail, indeterminate pre-trial detention,&lt;br&gt;
poverty, violence, inadequate food and constant uncomfortable&lt;br&gt;
accomodations) that mastery of digital storytelling or Python&lt;br&gt;
programming may be a viable path out of poverty either with or without&lt;br&gt;
a college degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture above was taken on Rikers Island in the last place we were&lt;br&gt;
allowed to keep our phones.  It is the parking lot outside the&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/teen-murder-at-rikers-jail-6394103"&gt;infamous&lt;/a&gt; Robert N.  Davoren complex where prisoners as young as&lt;br&gt;
sixteen are detained. For those interested in learning more about these &lt;br&gt;
fascinating young men and their struggle to survive inside and make sense&lt;br&gt;
of their brutal surroundings, please follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%2540rikersbot&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;@RikersBot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
