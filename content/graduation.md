# Teaching Advanced Probability to undergraduates and other interlopers

This is not the optimal transport reading group.

This photo is of the Spring 2025 Advanced Probability class on our last 
day of office hours, May 3rd. We were treated to a new lecture that explained
the way in which to proability measures where one was absolutely continuous
with the other but not the reverse led to a process being a strict local 
martingale.

I don't know if it is typical that this many people smile in a math class
but I have not seen it often. The OT Reading Group came out of a graduate
class on Probability and Analysis.  Jose, our organizer was using OT in his
research on multiple sources of factor risk and suggested Dr. Karatzas 
give us his treatment of the material. ([Dr. Nestor Gullien](https://www.ndguillen.com/))
gave 4 lectures. The lectures were so popular that we formed a 
reading group for the next semester.

To our surprise and delight gave a series of lectures from the
perspective of Partial Differential Equations, all of us had at least
some experience with that area. Dr. Karatzas then continued and gave
us his perspective on the proofs of Benhamou and Brenier and
Rockefeller on convex optimization.

From a pedagological viewpoint it was far ahead of most of us
but part of the magic of high rather than low expectations is that 
people work hard to rise to them. And I would assert that Victor 
Frankl would claim that is the reason for the smiles.
