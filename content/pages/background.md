# Past talks and background

NYC is the crossroads of the world and we have been unreasonably lucky 
to have this semester and last fundamental talks by Ioannis Karatzas and 
Nestor Gullien. Even better news, Dr. Karatzas distributed his notes
and Mark Ma used his other worldly LaTeX stenography tools to transcribe
the talk by Dr. Gullien.

# Resume

Here are the introductory talks to catch any of our new members up. 

1. ([Optimal Transport Notions](../images/01-optimal-transport-notions.pdf))
2. ([The Monge Problem](../images/02-the-monge-problem.pdf))
3. ([Quadratic Cost in Euclidean Space](../images/03-quadratic-cost-euclidean.pdf))
4. ([Gradient Flows in Hilbert Space](../images/04-gradient-flows-hilbert.pdf))
5. ([Basics of Riemannian Geometry](../images/05-basics-riemannian-geometry.pdf))

Dr. Nestor Gullen also gave a brilliant series of lectures to our group. (I hope to get his 
slides on the JKO scheme soon.) Through the hard work and prodigous skill of Mark Ma, we also 
have Dr Gullen's slides
