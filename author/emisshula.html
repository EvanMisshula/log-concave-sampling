<p>This is not the optimal transport reading group.</p>
<p>This photo is of the Spring 2025 Advanced Probability class on our last <br>
day of office hours, May 3rd. We were treated to a new lecture that explained<br>
the way in which to proability measures where one was absolutely continuous<br>
with the other but not the reverse led to a process being a strict local <br>
martingale.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is typical that this many people smile in a math class<br>
but I have not seen it often. The OT Reading Group came out of a graduate<br>
class on Probability and Analysis.  Jose, our organizer was using OT in his<br>
research on multiple sorces of factor risk and suggested Dr. Karatzas <br>
give us his treatment of the material. (<a href="https://www.ndguillen.com/">Dr. Nestor Gullien</a>)<br>
gave 4 lectures. The lectures were so popular that we formed a <br>
reading group for the next semester.</p>
<p>To our surprise and delight gave a series of lectures from the<br>
perspective of Partial Differential Equations, all of us had at least<br>
some experience with that area. Dr. Karatzas then continued and gave<br>
us his perspective on the proofs of Benhamou and Brenier and<br>
Rockefeller on convex optimization.</p>
<p>From a pedagological viewpoint it was far ahead of most of us<br>
but part of the magic of high rather than low expectations is that <br>
people work hard to rise to them. And I would assert that Victor <br>
Frankl would claim that is the reason for the smiles.</p>
